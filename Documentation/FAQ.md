> Why and when would I use this?

Check the "When would I use this?" section under [the README](https://github.com/ImNimboss/dshell/blob/main/README.md).

> Why is it called "discordshell" on PyPI instead of dshell?

PyPI wouldn't let me register the project with the name "dshell", presumably because it was too similar to another project named "dbshell".
