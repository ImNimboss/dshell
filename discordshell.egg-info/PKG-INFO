        ## Description
        
        Discord shell or dshell for short is a Python package that combines with [discord.py](https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py) and [Jishaku](https://github.com/Gorialis/jishaku) to transform an ordinary Discord channel into one capable of running bash commands using a Discord bot.

        ## When would I use this?
        
        * When you want to use shell commands on your virtual machine without logging into it
        * When you want a collaborative terminal with other developers of your team
        * When you're simply too lazy to open your shell and would rather do it in an open Discord app
        * When you want to run shell commands from your Discord bot's directory easily
        * When you want to run shell commands on something that simply looks better than your shell
